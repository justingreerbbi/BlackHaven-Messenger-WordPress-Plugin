# Mobile Application Notes

This document provides essential information and guidelines for the Blackhaven Messenger client application development.

## Overview

IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLIENT TO KEEP THINGS SECURE AND DO THINGS RIGHT! The plugin is opensource but apps may not be so do things nicely.

## App Features Should Support

- Authorizing and adding a public key to the server for each logged in user. This is actually required in order for this all to work.
- Consider using Push notifications as a means of pulling data. A hybrid solution of polling and listening for a PUSH to pull. Shared hosting friendly!
- The whole idea is security. Be secure and TAKE NO shortcuts. Vibe coders are not welcome here.
